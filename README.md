##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Uber Fares Dataset** to discover fare trends, ride demand patterns, and operational insights.  
The dataset was cleaned and enhanced using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, and an **interactive Power BI dashboard** was built to visualize key findings.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- Perform **data cleaning and feature engineering**.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with KPIs and trends.
- Provide **actionable insights** and **business recommendations**.

## Project Structure

---

##  Dashboard Features
- **KPI Cards**: Total Rides, Total Fare Collected, Average Fare.
- **Fare Distribution**: Histogram and box plot of fare amounts.
- **Time-Based Trends**:  
  - Ride frequency and average fare by **hour**, **day of the week**, and **month**.
- **Fare vs Distance**: Scatter plot showing fare-distance correlation.
- **Interactive Slicers**: Month, Day, and Hour filters for exploring patterns.

---

##  Insights and Results
The analysis of Uber fares shows that **most rides fall within the 5–15 fare units range**, with outliers above 50.  
The fare distribution is **right-skewed**, with a median fare around **8–10 units**.  

- **Peak Hours:** 6–9 AM and 4–7 PM (commute times).  
- **Weekend Trends:** Higher ride activity and fares on **Fridays and Saturdays**.  
- **Distance vs Fare:** A strong positive correlation exists, with **longer trips incurring higher but variable fares**.  

---

##  Recommendations
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Apply surge pricing during peak hours and weekends.
- **Off-Peak Promotions:** Offer discounts to increase demand during off-peak times.
- **Data Validation:** Monitor outliers (> 50 units) to ensure quality and accuracy
