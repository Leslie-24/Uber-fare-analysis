##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Uber Fares Dataset** to discover fare trends, ride demand patterns, and operational insights.  
The dataset was cleaned and enhanced using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, and an **interactive Power BI dashboard** was built to visualize key findings.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- Perform **data cleaning and feature engineering**.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with KPIs and trends.
- Provide **actionable insights** and **business recommendations**.

##  Insights & Results

The analysis shows that **most fares fall between 5–15 units**, with outliers above 50.  
Ride demand peaks during **6–9 AM** and **4–7 PM**, especially on **Fridays and Saturdays**.  
The **fare vs distance scatter plot** confirms a positive correlation, with longer trips showing greater fare variability.  
Average fares increase late at night, likely due to longer rides or surge pricing.

---

##  Recommendations
- Apply **dynamic pricing** during peak hours and weekends.  
- Offer **off-peak promotions** to encourage rides at low-demand times.  
- Validate **outlier fares (>50 units)** for accuracy.  
- Incorporate **weather or event data** for richer analysis.
